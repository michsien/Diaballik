# Diaballik


My implementation of a board game Diaballik (code comments currently only in Polish). The prepared .exe file should be run in compatibility mode for Windows 7.

Rules for the Diaballik game can be found in the Help menu or on this website: http://diaballik.com/EN/Rules.html


# Features

The key features of this implementation are:
  1. Gamemodes allowing for competing with another person or with a computer-generated opponent.
  2. Game editor allowing for editing the current state of the game and starting from any initial setup.
  3. Game replay window allowing for browsing through the recorded moves and replaying any chosen part of the game.
  4. Saving and loading a game from a file.
